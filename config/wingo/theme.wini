# This file contains all theme information for Wingo. For the most part, this
# includes changing colors, fonts, font sizes, border and icon sizes. This is 
# enough to completely configure your own color scheme for Wingo, but you won't
# be able to make any structural changes to the window decorations.
#
# Wingo's configuration files are very similar to a regular INI file, except
# that simple variable substitution is allowed. Namely, a variable can be
# defined anywhere in the file (and re-defined) and then used in place of
# where a value might go. You can see a few examples of using such variables
# below.
#
# There two primary themeable portions of Wingo: window decorations and
# prompts. There are four different kinds of decorations that can be configured
# separately, and many different kinds of prompts that all use the same theme
# configuration. The sections "Full", "Borders", and "Slim" correspond
# to three of the four frame decorations (the fourth is "Nada" and does not
# have any appearance, and therefore has no theme), and the "Prompt" section 
# corresponds to the prompt theme information.
#
# Here is a brief description of each kind of window decoration:
#
# Full      Your standard window decorations. Complete with a title bar, window
#           icon, and buttons to minimize/maximize/close the window. This
#           decoration is typically used on windows that are floating.
#
# Borders   A border decoration that is responsive to mouse input. This
#           decoration is typically used on windows that are tiling.
#
# Slim      A simpler border decoration that is NOT responsive to mouse input.
#           This decoration is typically used on windows that ask not to be
#           decorated, but are still normal clients. (Like 'gmrun'.) The "Slim"
#           decoration can be effectively disabled by setting its border size
#           to 0.
#
# Nada      No decorations at all. Thus, there is no theming section for it
#           since it has no appearance. This decoration is typically used on
#           windows that aren't normal clients (like desktops and docks) and
#           windows that ask not to be decorated AND specially shape their
#           window (like Google Chrome/Chromium).
#
#
# Gradients
# ---------
# There are four theme options below that can accept two colors, which
# when combined, describe a gradient starting from the first color and ending
# at the second. These options are: [Full]/a_title_color, [Full]/i_title_color,
# [Borders]/a_border_color and [Borders]/i_border_color.
#
#
# File paths
# ----------
# There are several options below that require you to specify a file path,
# like fonts and images. These should always be absolute paths.
#
# Note that if a path is incorrect, Wingo will log a warning to stderr. More 
# importantly, none of these paths *must* be correct for Wingo to operate. 
# Wingo will fall back to embedded defaults.
#
# N.B. Several file paths below are relative. They are meant to serve as
# placeholders that refer to the actual files in Wingo's git repository. In
# actuality, Wingo will (probably) fail to find them, and fallback to embedded
# defaults.
#
#
# Naming convention
# -----------------
# The single letter "a" refers to an "active" state and the single letter "i"
# refers to an "inactive" state.
#
#
# Miscellaneous
# -------------
# The only option here is a path to the default Wingo icon. This is used for
# windows that don't specify an icon.
